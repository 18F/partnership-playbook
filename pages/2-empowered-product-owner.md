title: 2. We work with an empowered product owner
---
It’s important to us to get a full sense of your organization’s needs and priorities. We know our partners’ challenges can be highly complex and complicated with interoffice and stakeholder relationships. We’ve found that management of this complexity is best performed within your organization. To that end, we ask for one empowered product owner for day-to-day decisions and overall strategy guidance. Having this person named at the very beginning helps us focus on building the best product possible for you. 

###What does this mean for you?
We work best with an empowered product owner who can make decisions about the project we’re partnering on. In agile development, a product owner is responsible for project scoping and prioritizing. Our delivery team will rely on the product owner for direction as the project develops. This product owner must be empowered to make decisions about the product. The product owner should be experienced at getting buy-in from other organizational leaders; support should be lined up before our engagement. 

Your product owner and other relevant team members are part of a joint product team with 18F designers, product managers, and developers. We will explore the problem, do research to understand user needs, and design a solution together. Therefore, we look for a product owner who can devote at least 50 percent of their time to the project. The product owner is a core member of the design team and has plenty to do. In addition to participating in workshops, user research, and making product priority decisions, the product owner is also responsible for ensuring the agency recruits users, resolves agency governance issues, collaborates with other internal stakeholders, and more. 

We look for a product owner who has already lined up internal stakeholder support. Any project will impact a number of internal agency groups and systems, so it will need buy-in and technical integration support from those people. The product owner garners this buy-in and support. Before the engagement starts, the owner should have had conversations with and identified champions in relevant internal groups. Beginning these conversations in the middle of development can grind everything to a halt; they should be well underway by the time a digital service team is brought on board to deliver. We recommend that you map out the relevant stakeholders before embarking on a project.

###How do you know if you have an empowered product owner? 
>- Is your product owner experienced with aligning stakeholders within the organization? 
- Does your product owner have the authority to make decisions about the project?
- Has your product owner begun conversations and identified champions with necessary internal agency groups and stakeholders? Is there a diagram or stakeholder map of this? 
- Does an internal governance process exist that the product owner can use to resolve issues as they arise? Does the product owner have support from your agency’s leadership team with the expectation that they may need to ask for favors?
- Are there any other large initiatives underway that will pull attention away from the project? 
- Has your product owner set aside at least 50 percent of their time to work on this project?
- Are there significant stakeholders that should be but are not yet part of the project?
- Is the product owner able to work with and align stakeholders?
